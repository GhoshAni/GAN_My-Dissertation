# GAN
Generative Adverserial Network is a game changer in the world of deep learning and computervision once introduced in 2014.
Currently I have uploaded my Dissertation in the repository. Please note that all satellite images belong to Bird.I and not available for sharing.

My Dissertation (Image To Image Translation):

Satellite Imagery is a very valuable dataset for various domains like Agriculture, Natural Dis- aster Management, construction, Oil & Gas Sector. The accurate, real time images help to monitor and understand the real time changes occurring day to day or month to month ba- sis on earth like Disaster Management. Satellite images have been successfully used to diagnose Thunderstorms Tournedos[3].


The images help monitor the real-time progress of construction in housing or the images can provide a key benefit to the Infrastructure Sector. Large areas of land captured in one image give the user up-to-date views of lands ranging across several kilometres. The images capture roads, bridges, malls, railway tracks and other active construction sites on a periodical basis frequently by satellites.



Though these images are immensely helpful for progress monitoring and other applications, currently there is no application available which can predict the progress and changes of lands throughout the lifetime of construction for infrastructure or oil and gas monitoring or any other sector. An active development site goes through many changes like paving the road, foundations being laid, houses or bridges or factories or oil pipelines being constructed etc.



So an Image captured in a particular location will show some changes in the constructions compared to a previous image captured in the same location.
The goal of this project is to find out a possible approach to generate images similar to the changed landscape given input images of the same location with a time-lapse basically trans- lating to predict an image from a given image after a certain time lapse. Image to Image translation techniques available within the GAN family is chosen specifically as GAN has been successfully used to generate images for generating maps or rivers or different land- scapes from satellite images.

This repository provides a sample GAN architecture. The code for this work belongs to BirdI and can not be published. Please note all the satellite images used in this document are property of BirdI and should not be used commercially.
